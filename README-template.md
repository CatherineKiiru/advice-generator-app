# Advice Generator App Solution

This is my solution to the [Advice generator app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/advice-generator-app-QdUG-13db). 


## Overview

This project involved building an advice generator app that fetches data from the advice API.


 ## The Challenge

- Implemented CSS elements and ensured the design is mobile responsive
- Implemented hover states in the button element
- Added the functionality that fetches data from an API and display the data on the UI with ReactJS
